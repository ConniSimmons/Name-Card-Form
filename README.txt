Which web event did you hook into to update the display name? 
    document.getElementById('display').innerHTML

Where in your HTML did you link to your JavaScript file? Are there better places? What's the best place? 
    In the header.  No, I think the header is the cleanest place.

Why is it best practice to store your CSS/JS in external files rather than in your HTML file? 
    Storing JS and CSS in separate files keeps all three types of files (HTML, JS, CSS) neat and easier to interpret.
